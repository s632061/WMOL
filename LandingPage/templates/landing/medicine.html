          <h2>Why this Method Exists</h2>
          <p>
            I developed this method after a decade of studying in environments where time, energy, and resources were limited.
          </p>  
            <p>What I found was that most learning struggles weren’t due to a lack of discipline or intelligence, but rather inefficiencies in the learning process itself.</p>
            <p>The Wang Method of Learning is the system I wish I had earlier: a way to learn deeply without sacrificing health, relationships, or identity.

    <h2 class="med-explainer-title">What this Method Solves</h2>

    <p>
      Most students don’t struggle because they lack discipline or intelligence.
      They struggle because friction in their learning process makes progress inefficient and unsustainable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Wang Method of Learning removes those friction points so effort translates directly into clarity, confidence, and results.

    <h4>Academic background</h4>
    <p>
      Student at USUHS, Class of 2027. Graduated high school in 2010, enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, returned to
      school in phases, completed a BS (Strategic Studies and Defense Analysis, 2019), then EMDP2 (2021) before USUHS.
      Graduated Summa Cum Laude from Norwich University.
    </p>

    <h4>How fast it took to learn the method / stress effects</h4>
    <p>
      Read <em>Remember It</em> in ~6 hours, applied immediately, and saw meaningful improvement in ~2 weeks.
      Stress progressively decreased the more the method was practiced.
    </p>

    <h4>Study time + grade changes</h4>
    <p>
      Tracked total study hours per module. Before using the method: ~120–130 hours per midterm and ~150–160 hours per final.
      After applying the method: Repro/Endo dropped to 70 and 60 hours; Multisystems dropped to 45 and 35 hours.
    </p>

    <table aria-label="NBME grades rounded to nearest percent">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Module</th>
          <th>Midterm</th>
          <th>Final</th>
        </tr>

      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Foundations</td><td>61%</td><td>75%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>MSK</td><td>78%</td><td>70%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CPR</td><td>64%</td><td>76%</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Multisystem</td><td>76%</td><td>80%</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      In summary: average NBME score pre-method was 69.6%; post-method average was 77%.
      Highest score (80%) was achieved using ~22% of prior “final week” study hours.
    </p>

    <h4>Time back outside school</h4>
    <p>
      Reported getting significant time back and using it to repair family strain.
      Pre-method: studied 7 days/week, ~5 hours/day outside class, with no days off.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the method improving efficiency and performance, reclaimed time and rebuilt balance, especially time with spouse
      after years of prior enlisted service and deployments/training separations.
    </p>

    <h4>Fitness / balance</h4>
    <p>
      Also used time back to readdress fitness and nutrition, describing “fitness as medicine” and rebuilding balance alongside family time.

  // ✅ “View full breakdown” (full doc-style narrative)
  fullHtml: `
    <h4>Academic background</h4>
    <p>
      Attended public high school and Towson University. Describes being an average student and not typically spending hours studying.
      Took a year off after college for clinical experience and MCAT prep before medical school.
    </p>

    <h4>How fast it took to learn the method / stress effects</h4>
    <p>
      Started after the CPR midterm; by the final (~1 month later) had a fair sense of how it worked.
      Stress improved: felt less overwhelmed and more in control of what was known versus what still needed work.
    </p>

    <h4>Study time, effort, and grade changes</h4>
    <p>
      Cut out writing out all notes (removed the “middle man”), but effort improved because studying became more enjoyable and purposeful.
      “Ridiculous stories” helped concepts make sense and stick; practice questions then reinforced it.
    </p>

    <h4>Results</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Over 40% better on the CPR final than the CPR midterm.</li>
      <li>Over 40% higher on an NBME midterm retake with less than a week to study.</li>
      <li>Reports neuro module grades “have never been better.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Time back outside school</h4>
    <p>
      Reports more time for family, returning to working out, feeling ahead of the curve, better practice question performance,
      and improved recall of facts others didn’t recognize.
    </p>

    <h4>Have you used anything like this before?</h4>
    <p>
      Had used mnemonics before, but they blurred together. In contrast, stories/pictures were unique and tied to specific topics,
      with trigger words bringing back the content even after the module ended.

  fullHtml: `
    <h4>Academic background</h4>
    <p>
      I graduated with a BS in Biology in 2012 with decent grades. I did no school for 10 years before beginning pre-med
      post-bachelor studies. I did very well in my post-graduate studies and decent on my MCAT. I’ve never really struggled
      with school, and I’ve been performing very well in medical school so far.
    </p>

    <h4>How fast it took to learn the method / stress effects</h4>
    <p>
      It took about 2–3 weeks to really understand the method, although I had to adjust a little to make it work with my
      learning modality. It wasn’t until after the first midterm exams that I felt confident in the method.
    </p>
    <p>
      My stress went down once I realized I could pass comfortably and still do very well on my exams. For the final, I was
      very confident I would pass.
    </p>

    <h4>Time saved / outcomes</h4>
    <p>
      It shaved off about 1–2 hours per day during the week and between 5–10 hours on the weekends. I estimate between 15 and
      20 hours a week, with only a small point drop in my GPA—about 3 points. I still pass with pretty good grades, and now I
      have more time for me.
    </p>

    <h4>Time back outside school</h4>
    <p>
      I am a father of two small children, and I chose this path to create a better life for them and be able to raise them
      rather than watch them grow old through FaceTime overseas. The slight drop in my GPA was well worth the time I got back
      with my family. I got to be present for my kids’ lives and help mend a marriage that the Army lifestyle challenged on so
      many occasions.
    </p>

    <h4>One concrete example</h4>
    <p>
      I take my son to the park and do Saturday fun days instead of coming into the library and spending hours in my cubicle.
    </p>

    <h4>Have I used anything like this before?</h4>
    <p>No.</p>

  proof: [
    "Studying felt more efficient without needing longer hours.",

  fullHtml: `
    <h4>Before using the method</h4>
    <p>
      Before using the method, I constantly felt behind. I spent a lot of time rewriting notes,
      organizing material, and trying to cover everything, but it never translated into confidence.
      The volume felt overwhelming and mentally exhausting.
    </p>

    <h4>What changed</h4>
    <p>
      Once I started using the method, studying became much more intentional.
      Instead of guessing what mattered, I had a clear structure for how to learn and what to focus on.
    </p>

    <h4>Time and energy</h4>
    <p>
      I didn’t necessarily study more hours, but I got more out of the time I did spend.
      That made a huge difference in my energy levels and overall stress.
    </p>

    <h4>What I did with the time back</h4>
    <p>
      Having time back allowed me to rest, exercise, and decompress.
      That balance made it easier to stay consistent and avoid burnout as the block continued.

  fullHtml: `
    <h4>Academic background</h4>
    <p>
      I graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and came straight to USU.
      I studied applied physics and generally avoided subjects that required heavy memorization.
    </p>

    <h4>Time, energy, and stress constraints</h4>
    <p>
      In January, I sustained a concussion and missed a week of school.
      Because it was my fifth concussion, staring at screens for the next eight weeks was uncomfortable and exhausting.
      I needed 9–10 hours of sleep per night and couldn’t exercise at all without getting dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I passed every exam, the continuous doctor appointments, inability to fully rest,
      and social isolation during recovery made the lifestyle exhausting.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning the method</h4>
    <p>
      During the last few weeks of the neuroscience module, Will talked me through his method for retaining information.
      I used the method during those final weeks and received the same scores with about half the effort.
      Most importantly, I was actually able to rest.
    </p>

    <h4>Changes in efficiency and performance</h4>
    <p>
      While my overall work quality stayed the same, the time it took me to complete material and retain it shrank significantly.
      The method allowed me to tailor information to how my memory works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I spent less time trying to retain information, I had more time to use it.
      In pathology and small groups, I became a more active participant and could reason through cases
      without constantly consulting peers or instructors.
    </p>
    <p>
      My pathology quiz scores improved from mostly 2-3s to nearly straight 5s,
      and when instructors asked questions, I actually had an idea of the answer.
    </p>

    <h4>What I did with the time back</h4>
    <p>
      The additional free time supported my recovery, but it also opened new opportunities.
      I prepared to serve as ACME TA XO for the MS2 MilMed exercise, which became my first leadership role at USU.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was also able to start swimming and cycling again and am now training for a triathlon.
      I even earned my scuba certification during the Neuro and GI modules.
    </p>

    <h4>What would have happened without the method</h4>
    <p>
      Without this method, I think I would have burned out and struggled significantly during GI.
      The ability to rest made a critical difference.
    </p>

    <h4>Have I used anything like this before?</h4>
    <p>
      I had experienced something similar when memorizing Shakespeare for my theater company,
      but this approach was far more intentional and structured.

    <h4>Before the method</h4>
    <p>
      I came into medical school with a strong academic background overall, but I struggled early at USU.
      I’d been out of a traditional academic environment for a bit due to military commitments, and once MS1 started,
      I felt overwhelmed by the volume, pace, and complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I relied on brute-force studying, excessive note-taking, and long hours that didn’t always translate to retention.
      I was constantly searching for something more efficient and sustainable.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning the method</h4>
    <p>
      It took me about 3-4 weeks to really grasp the method and start applying it the right way.
      By the two-month mark, I could feel a real shift in how much information I retained and how quickly I could understand new material.
    </p>

    <h4>Stress, control, and exam prep</h4>
    <p>
      The biggest difference was my stress level. Instead of feeling behind or unsure if I was studying the “right” things,
      I felt in control of my learning. The predictable structure, memory-based approach, and reduced need for notes made everything feel lighter.
      My exam prep felt calmer and more deliberate rather than frantic.
    </p>

    <h4>Time and performance changes</h4>
    <p>
      Before using this method, I was studying 8-10+ hours a day and still didn’t feel confident.
      After switching, I averaged about 5-6 hours a day, and the quality of those hours was significantly higher.
      I wasn’t rewriting notes, I was retaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      My practice question accuracy improved, my ability to reason through unfamiliar questions got better,
      and my grades and in-class assessments reflected that.
    </p>

    <h4>What I did with the time back</h4>
    <p>
      Getting time back was one of the biggest advantages. Instead of spending every evening buried in material,
      I had room to breathe again. I could keep up with personal responsibilities and maintain physical training
      without feeling guilty.
    </p>

    <h4>What changed outside school</h4>
    <p>
      One of the biggest wins was being able to take care of my health without feeling like I was sacrificing academics.
      I also regained the mental space to enjoy other parts of life without constantly thinking about studying.
      That balance honestly made me a better student overall.
    </p>

    <h4>Have I used anything like this before?</h4>
    <p>
      I tried things like Anki, passive rereading, handwritten flashcards, and review sessions.
      None of them gave me the same combination of efficiency, long-term memory, and actual comprehension.
      The structured memory approach with strategic resource use and targeted question practice ended up being exactly what I needed.

    <h4>Academic background</h4>
    <p>
      I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a BS in Biology.
      I took about a year off from school with little academic work during that time,
      but did well enough overall to get into USUHS.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning the method and stress effects</h4>
    <p>
      The method allowed me to cut through a lot of the unnecessary work much faster.
      Instead of drilling endlessly, I could identify what actually mattered and move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      That alone lowered my stress because I didn’t feel like I had to grind nonstop
      just to keep up.
    </p>

    <h4>Time, effort, and performance</h4>
    <p>
      My total study time stayed about the same, but the first pass through material
      was much quicker and the information stuck better.
      Because of that, my grades stayed about the same with less overall effort.
    </p>

    <h4>What I did with the time back</h4>
    <p>
      Since I wasn’t bogged down in the LRC all the time, I could take a few more days
      off and devote time to other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was able to run more consistently and train for the Marine Corps Marathon,
      and I could also spend more time with friends instead of always being in the library.
    </p>

    <h4>Have I used anything like this before?</h4>
    <p>
      I had used tools like Sketchy before because of the storyboard format,
      but those often relied on random storylines that had to be memorized.
      This method felt more natural because it anchored memory to personal experiences
      rather than arbitrary associations.

    <h4>Academic background</h4>
    <p>
      Before medical school, I was a non-science major in undergrad and completed a post-baccalaureate program afterward.
      When I first started medical school, I struggled significantly and ended up having to repeat my first year.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning the method and stress</h4>
    <p>
      After changing my study habits and learning this method, things clicked.
      It took about two weeks to learn, and once I understood how to apply it,
      my stress around exams dropped because I felt more confident in what I knew.
    </p>

    <h4>Time, effort, and grades</h4>
    <p>
      I was able to decrease the total amount of time I spent studying while keeping the same level of effort as before.
      Even though I was spending less time handling material, my grades improved significantly.
    </p>

    <h4>What I did with the time back</h4>
    <p>
      With the extra time, I was able to work out consistently and spend more time with my family,
      which I didn’t really have the ability to do before.
    </p>

    <h4>Life outside school</h4>
    <p>
      Because I felt more comfortable with the content and less anxious about falling behind,
      I was able to travel more without constantly stressing about school.
    </p>

    <h4>Have I used anything like this before?</h4>
    <p>
      I tried using other study plans and Sketchy before, but this method worked better for
      remembering concepts long term rather than just memorizing facts.

    <h4>Academic background</h4>
    <p>
      I graduated from Southern Methodist University in 2024 with a BS in Biochemistry and minors in Business and Neuroscience.
      I graduated summa cum laude and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. During undergrad, I became very efficient at studying
      by emphasizing active recall and practice problems, and I did not take time off before starting medical school.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning the method and stress effects</h4>
    <p>
      It took about two sets of exams, roughly two months, for me to really improve with this method.
      By creating stories and mental images to represent medical concepts, I was able to learn material faster
      and recall it with less effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still use Anki and practice questions, but they now reinforce the mental stories I’ve created instead of being the
      primary way I learn. This made my reviews faster and allowed me to space them out more without losing retention.
    </p>

    <h4>Time, effort, and performance</h4>
    <p>
      I don’t have an exact hour count, but my studying now feels much more efficient.
      I stay engaged in lectures because I’m actively building mental images instead of passively listening.
      Leading up to exams, I’m reinforcing concepts rather than learning everything for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days before exams, I no longer need to study intensively. I usually spend only a few hours reviewing.
      Overall, I estimate my total study time has decreased by about 25%, and my grades have been maintained or improved.
    </p>

    <h4>What I did with the time back</h4>
    <p>
      With the time I saved, I was able to focus on competing in the Order of Merit List (OML) for a slot at Air Assault School.
      Cardio had always been a weakness of mine, and the OML heavily emphasizes endurance events like 6-12 mile ruck marches
      and a 5-mile run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the extra time this method gave me, I could finally prioritize fitness again.
      I earned a spot at Air Assault School this summer and completed the Norwegian Ruck March (30 km / 18.6 miles),
      training twice a week with friends, something that wouldn’t have been possible before.
    </p>

    <h4>Have I used anything like this before?</h4>
    <p>
      I’ve always believed in active learning and avoiding passive note-taking.
      This method feels like an upgraded version of active learning because it builds on how the brain naturally retains
      information, through stories and images, and applies it to the volume of medical content we’re expected to master.
