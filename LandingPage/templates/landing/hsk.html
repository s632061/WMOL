<div class="hsk-acc-panel" data-acc-panel>

    <h3 class="hsk-subhead">The Problem</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    I didn’t grow up being very good at learning languages. In fact, in first grade,
    I ended up failing Chinese school twice. And for a long time after that, every attempt to learn a language
    felt like a repeated cycle of effort without traction: memorize a
    little, forget a lot, and never feel fluent enough to actually connect.
    What made it frustrating wasn’t a lack of resources.
    There were plenty of apps, decks, videos, and textbooks.
    The problem was that they were scattered, inconsistent, and often built
    around studying instead of actually using the language. That made steady progress hard to sustain, especially when time was short and energy was low.
    I’d lose momentum not because I lacked discipline, but because the workflow
    itself had too many friction points.
  </p>

    <h3 class="hsk-subhead">The System</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    While I eventually sidelined language learning because of those friction
    points, I never stopped trying to understand why they existed and how to
    remove them. That process eventually became the Wang Method of Learning.
    Over the course of more than a decade, across demanding academic and
    professional environments, I refined a system designed to succeed under
    constraint in both time and energy, not abundance.
    By systematically identifying and removing friction that had nothing to
    do with the work itself, the method helps people learn, understand, and
    apply large amounts of information in significantly less time.
    It wasn’t developed in ideal conditions; it was stress-tested when time
    was limited, energy was low, and competing priorities were unavoidable.
    That’s where most systems fail and where mine thrives.
  </p>

   <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Why Chinese</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Chinese became an obvious and personal place to apply it.
    I learned that language isn’t just information; it’s access.
    It’s the ability to meet people where they are, understand them with
    precision, and communicate with warmth and respect.
    I wanted that for myself, especially in an area tied to my roots that I
    never fully had the tools to explore.
    And I wanted a way for others to get there without the usual chaos:
    ten tools, a hundred tabs, and constant uncertainty about what actually
    matters next.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">What This Means For You</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    So I built what I wished I’d had from the start:
    a single, integrated framework that makes Chinese feel stable.
    Vocabulary organized into structured blocks.
    Practice designed around real usage, not isolated recognition.
    Sentences that build automaticity.
    And small decisions, what to review, what to repeat, what to skip, etc., handled
    by the system so your attention can stay on learning.
    The HSK 1-6 Companion App is the result of applying a decade-refined method
    to language learning under real-world constraints.
    It’s not a language app.
    It’s a reliable learning system built to help you move from effort to
    fluency without losing yourself along the way.
  </p>

    <button class="hsk-acc-btn" type="button" data-acc-btn>
      How This Is Different
      <span class="hsk-acc-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="hsk-acc-panel" data-acc-panel>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Designed For Constraint</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Most language apps assume you have abundant time, high energy, and perfect consistency.
    This system is built for the opposite: busy schedules, low-energy days, and real life.
    The goal isn’t to “feel productive", it's to make progress inevitable.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Structured Blocks, Not Scattered Lists</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Instead of endless decks and disconnected word banks, content is organized into structured blocks
    with a clear path forward. You always know what you’re working on, what’s next,
    and what “done” looks like without hunting across multiple resources.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Real Acceptance Logic</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    This app recognizes correct variation, alternate phrasing, spacing, punctuation, and common natural answers
    so you don’t get punished for being right in a different way, especially in later blocks.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Application First Practice</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Sentences are the backbone of the system, so words are applied in context as early as possible.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">A Smooth Review Loop</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Review is built to be simple and predictable:
    redo omitted, redo incorrect, revisit intelligently.
    The system handles the small decisions so your attention stays on learning.
    Less friction, less mental bookkeeping, and a workflow that feels steady instead of exhausting.
  </p>

    <button class="hsk-acc-btn" type="button" data-acc-btn>
      How This Fits Your Learning
      <span class="hsk-acc-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
    </button>
   <div class="hsk-acc-panel" data-acc-panel>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">What This Is</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    This app is for learners who care about understanding, not just checking boxes.
    If you want a system that helps you actually use Chinese, to read, listen, think,
    and communicate, this was built with you in mind.
    It’s especially suited for people with busy schedules, multiple commitments,
    or limited daily energy, who still want steady, meaningful progress without burnout.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">How This Fits Into Your Learning Path</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    This app is designed to work alongside many different learning contexts.
    It can be used as a companion for students currently taking classes,
    helping organize, reinforce, and stabilize what’s being taught elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    It can also augment immersive experiences like travel, conversation partners,
    or daily exposure, by giving structure to what you’re encountering in real time.
  </p>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    For others, it serves as a foundation: a way to train what’s already written,
    spoken, and standardized so that new material is easier to absorb later.
 </p>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    And for learners who don’t have access to expensive classes, tutors,
    or immersive environments, this system provides a structured, self-directed path forward.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">About Writing And Handwriting</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    This app is intentionally typing-based. That choice is deliberate.
    Handwriting and calligraphy are valuable skills, but they’re different skills from comprehension,
    recognition, and functional use. This system is optimized for understanding, recall,
    and application, the foundations that make writing meaningful instead of mechanical.
  </p>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    If handwriting is important to you, this app pairs well with dedicated writing practice.
    Many learners find that once comprehension is stable and vocabulary is automatic,
    writing improves faster and with far less friction.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">What This Is Not</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    This is not a handwriting-first or calligraphy training tool.
    If your primary goal is stroke-order mastery or traditional calligraphy,
    this won’t replace dedicated writing practice.
    It’s also not designed for learners who want random drills, heavy gamification,
    or endless novelty without structure.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">What To Expect If You Use It</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    You should expect a calm, predictable learning experience.
    Progress that feels stable instead of frantic.
    Clear structure, fewer decisions, and a system that meets you where you are and helps you move forward without unnecessary friction.
  </p>

    </button>
 <div class="hsk-acc-panel" data-acc-panel>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">HSK Alignment & Character Set</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    The app is built around Simplified Chinese, aligning directly with HSK requirements.
    Vocabulary follows the new HSK 3.0 framework, with words organized by their official bands
    so learners always know where they stand.
  </p>

    <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Progress Tracking & Weekly Structure</h3>
<p class="hsk-text">
  Progress is structured around weekly plans designed to define the minimum effective work
  needed to move forward. Each week outlines exactly what to train, removing guesswork
  while keeping expectations realistic.
</p>
<p class="hsk-text">
  Learners can move faster, slower, or jump ahead as needed, but the baseline structure
  ensures progress remains steady even during busy or low-energy periods.
  The system tracks completion through structured blocks rather than abstract streaks
  or gamified metrics.
</p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Structured Word Blocks</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Vocabulary is organized into 100-word blocks sorted by HSK 3.0 level.
    This creates clear, finite units of progress and removes the ambiguity of endless word lists.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Offline Support & Data Syncing</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    The app works fully offline for normal use.
    An internet connection is only required after extended periods away from the app
    for subscription validation and updates.
    Learning content is delivered in small, secure packages to support offline access
    while protecting the integrity of the system’s data.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Platform Support</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    The HSK 1-6 Companion App is available on iOS and Android,
    designed for consistent performance and long-term use across both platforms.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Adapted Memory Techniques</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    The app incorporates a structured memory approach inspired by techniques developed
    by six-time USA Memory Champion Nelson Dellis, adapted specifically for language learning
    to improve retention, recall, and long-term stability.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Practice Designed For Real-World Skills</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Each question type targets a specific friction point in language learning:
    sentence construction under pressure, active pronunciation,
    real-time listening comprehension, writing and character encoding,
    and increasing fluency across all of these skills.
    The goal is not to replicate the exam, but to make exam questions feel trivial by comparison.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Audio & Pronunciation Training</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Listening practice, pronunciation training, and audio support are built in,
    using recorded speech and text-to-speech to train both recognition and production.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Study Plans Built For Sustainability</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Study plans are designed to build stamina, reduce burnout,
    and deliver maximum results with minimum effective time investment.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">HSK Exam Breakdowns & Integration</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Each level includes a clear breakdown of exam structure,
    guidance on external resources, and instructions on how to integrate
    exam preparation with daily training inside the app.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Specialized Word Lists & Dictionary</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Curated word lists for topics like food, sports, surnames, and many more are included
    alongside a built-in dictionary that shows block placement and usage context.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Practice Sentence Generation</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    A dedicated practice sentence system allows learners to generate
    and train sentences dynamically, reinforcing grammar and comprehension.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Visual Comfort Modes</h3>
  <p class="hsk-text">
    Two visual themes are available: Volcanic Ash for low-light environments
    and Bamboo Paper for a brighter, reading-focused experience.
  </p>

  <h3 class="hsk-subhead">Data & Account Approach</h3>
<p class="hsk-text">
  This app does not require a separate user account.
  Subscriptions are handled through the App Store or Google Play.
  Learning progress is stored locally on your device, and the system is designed
  to function without collecting or selling personal study data.
</p>
<p class="hsk-text">
